Project exam 1: No Wheat, No Worries

"No Wheat, No Worries" is a responsive and user-friendly recipe blog designed to empower individuals with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. It provides a platform for sharing gluten-free recipes, tips, and inspiration for leading a joyful and fulfilling life through food.


Description

"No Wheat, No Worries" aims to:
- Share delicious and gluten-free recipes.
- Inspire individuals to embrace a gluten-free lifestyle without compromise.
- Create a visually appealing, accessible, and easy-to-navigate website.
  

This project was created using:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- WordPress API
- One.com for getting the API
- Netlify (for deployment)



The Installing and Running sections in your README file suggest steps for projects that involve dependencies and local server setups, often applicable for React, Node.js, or similar frameworks. However, since your project appears to be a static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript site (without dependency management like npm), these steps aren't strictly necessary.

Here’s how to adjust the README to match your project setup:

Revised "Getting Started" Section
If your project is a static website with no build tools or dependencies, replace the Installing and Running sections like this:

Getting Started
Installing
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

Clone the repository:
- Copy code:
    git clone [git@github.com:your-username/no-wheat-no-worries.git](https://github.com/JulieKristoffersen/Exam1-No-Wheat-No-Worries.git)
  
Open the project directory:

- Copy code:
    cd no-wheat-no-worries
    Open the index.html file in your browser to view the site.

Running
To preview the site on a local server (optional), you can use a lightweight development server like Live Server:

- Install Live Server (if you don't already have it):
    - For Visual Studio Code users: Install the Live Server extension.
        - Right-click index.html in your editor and select Open with Live Server.
