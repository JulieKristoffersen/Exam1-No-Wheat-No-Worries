          <p><strong>Welcome to our site</strong></p>
          <p>
            We’re a couple who shares a deep passion for baking and creating
            delicious food. One of us lives with celiac disease, but we firmly
            believe that dietary restrictions should never be a barrier to
            enjoying amazing meals. Our journey in the kitchen is all about
            experimenting, trying new things, and spreading love through each
            recipe we create.
          </p>
          <p>
            We’re here to show that gluten-free living doesn’t mean missing out
            on flavor or joy. Whether you’re baking something sweet or preparing
            a hearty dish, our goal is to inspire you to embrace every bite with
            enthusiasm. Celiac disease might bring challenges, but it should
            never stop anyone from experiencing the beauty and comfort of good
            food.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our mission is to share the joy of cooking and baking, highlighting
            that gluten-free options can be just as delightful and satisfying.
            We love discovering new recipes and alternatives that allow everyone
            to indulge in their favorite dishes without compromise. Join us as
            we share our love for baking, the joy we find in every dish, and our
            commitment to making gluten-free living a delicious adventure!
